# <img align="left" alt="Candide" width="36px" src="./assets/logo.png" />Candide Landing Page

I built a clone of the company's landing page in HTML/CSS/JS. This project was later upgraded to a Nuxt project.

The codebase is hosted in a private repo on Gitlab.

## Site Advancements

Improvements I made to the site after cloning it:

- I made the site fully responsive
- I built a server middleware to process and send email subscriptions to our mailing list provider
- I added validation, validation styles, and loading state to the email input as well as success/error popup components
- I improved the resolution and consistency of the team member avatar images
- I added the header which contains the links to our company whitepaper and social media pages
